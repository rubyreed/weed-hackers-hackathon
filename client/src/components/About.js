      <h1>Weed Hackers:</h1>
      <h3>Ruby Reed</h3>
      <p>We really aren't sure why Ruby is part of this group. She knows very little about gardening. She struggles to keep even the most basic plants alive. I mean seriously - who kills a cactus? I digress, I guess she maybe knows a little bit about fungi? She has a poster of it on her wall so I guess she at least pretends to be into it although I sort of suspect that she does it because it makes it hip and cool. She is also really hard on team members for basically no reason. She says she enjoys painting her face green and popping out of bushes to scare small children. I really think we should probably kick her out of the group...</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Dennis Plank</h3>
      <p>Dennis is kind of cool I guess? He's fun to work with and has some cool stories so that's always a plus. I really don't know that much about him. I think he mentioned that he owns a bus. I don't know how that is really relevant to gardening but really how many people can say that they own a bus? I think his favorite hobbies are like picking picking daisies in random fields and doing blind taste tests on soil to see if he can tell where the soil is from. It's kind of a cool talent but I would be terrified that a dog had already used that soil if you know what I mean.</p>

      <h3>Michael Knutson</h3>
      <p>Mike is basically the only normal one in the group. He actually is a fantastic gardener. This dude can literally grow almost anything. He is the most helpful member in any team and everything that he says is absolutely hilarious. He's also incredibly good-looking. Really this guy has like no bad qualities. If there was maybe one drawback it's that for some reason he likes to listen to Rockstar Sea Shanty by Nickelback. Honestly, that's even kind of cool though. His hobbies include rescuing puppies in poor situations, giving all his money to the underpriviliged, and donating all his spare time to help discover the cure to cancer.</p>
